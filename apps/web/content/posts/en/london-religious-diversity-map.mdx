Interesting map.

Interesting that the southern part of London is mostly Christian–atheist, while the north is "diverse", transitioning into "hyper-diverse".

Interesting that areas with predominantly African and Caribbean populations are more Christian than areas with a majority of native British population, where atheists prevail. I've often noticed, especially in Woolwich, how Nigerian missionaries preach Christianity to groups of white Britons. Ironic.

Interesting that the Buddhist community is shown only in Plumstead. What about Limehouse? Many Chinese and Southeast Asian people still live there.

Interesting that in Haringey the religious distribution perfectly matches the railway line.

Interesting that in areas dominated by Hindus, the only significant religious minority is Muslims. Do Christians and atheists not want to live in those areas?

Interesting that those who realize religion is a fiction are Christians.
