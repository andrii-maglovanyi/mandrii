Can you imagine that in the 1960s you could board a bus in London and ride all the way to India? Or even to Australia?

🚌 From 1957 to 1976, there was a regular bus service between London and Calcutta - a journey lasting 50 days and covering 32,700 km, making it the longest bus route in the world.

🗺 The route passed through 11 countries, with stops in cities such as Vienna, Istanbul, and Tehran, allowing passengers to go shopping and visit landmarks.

🎟️ A ticket cost £145 (about £3000 in today's money), and it included meals and accommodation on board.

😌 The bus offered every convenience:

- sleeping berths for each passenger
- a separate dining room
- an observation deck
- heating and a music system with radio and cassette tapes
- carpeted floors (of course, to feel just like home)

🦘 In 1968, Australian businessman Andy Steward launched an even more ambitious route - from Sydney to London via Calcutta. His double-decker bus, _Albert_, crossed three continents, completing 16 journeys in 8 years, 15 of which were round trips.

Albert's final trip was supposed to end in Australia, but due to the looming Islamic Revolution in Iran, the bus was left in London.

🧳 Would you have taken such a trip?
