## When you can return or replace an item

I'll replace or refund your order if:

- The product arrives **faulty or damaged**, or
- I made an embroidery mistake (wrong design, placement, or size).

Please email me within **7 days** of receiving your order at sales@broydy.com, including your order number and clear photos of the issue.

## When returns aren’t possible

- Change of mind or preference.
- Incorrect size, colour, or design provided by you.
- Minor variations in thread colour or texture (these are part of the customised embroidery process).
- Normal wear and tear or damage from incorrect washing.

## My promise

I check every order myself before shipping and will always do my best to fix any problem quickly.
