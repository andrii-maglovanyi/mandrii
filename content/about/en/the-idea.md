This is a space where I share stories, thoughts, and discoveries I find important - or just plain interesting - for the Ukrainian community. Whether you're in London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, or on a bus somewhere in between, you're welcome here.

## What's the idea?

I write about travel and discovery, history, culture, social change, and also share news and real-life stories from countries where Ukrainians live - to help us stay connected and share experiences, no matter where we are.

## Why does it matter?

Ukrainian culture, language, and identity - all of it is under threat today. In times like these, it's important to stay together, share ideas, support one another, and remember: we're not just random people in line at the checkout in Aldi. We're a community.

This site is a small but warm hub for ideas and discussion, collaboration and inspiration, as well as meeting others and feeling like you belong.

## Discover Ukrainian places

Looking for a taste of home, a familiar word, or a playlist of Ukrainian podcasts? Want to support fellow Ukrainians or simply find where to get a proper bowl of borscht?

This site includes a map of Ukrainian places and events across Europe, along with helpful tips, trusted contacts, and inspiring initiatives.

- Explore Ukrainian places across Europe - from borscht to bookshelves, from coffee to concerts
- Support your own - a kind word and a cheesecake latte go a long way
- Stay informed and share what you believe matters, just like grandma used to share her jam
- Send the link to a friend. Or your mom. Or that neighbour from Sheffield living in Kyiv - let them think you're in the know. Because you are
- And hey - don't get lost. We're in this together ðŸ’›ðŸ’™
